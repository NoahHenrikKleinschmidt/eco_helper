"""
This is ``eco_helper`` - a package to facilitate data handling and pre-processing for later work with the `EcoTyper framework <https://github.com/digitalcytometry/ecotyper>`_.
The tools offered by this package are all accessible via a command line interface and this is the intended way to use them. 
However, the package can be used directly as a library.
